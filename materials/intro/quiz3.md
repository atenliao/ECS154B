# Quiz 3 Solutions

## **Q1** Power and energy

In this question, you'll be asked to do some math to calculate the power and energy of a system.

The Pentium 4 Prescott processor, released in 2004, had a clock rate of 3.6 GHz and voltage of 1.25 V. Assume that, on average, it consumed 10 W of static power and 90 W of dynamic power.

The Core i5 Ivy Bridge, released in 2012, has a clock rate of 3.4 GHz and voltage of 0.9 V. Assume that, on average, it consumed 30 W of static power and 40 W of dynamic power.

### **Q1.1** Capacitive load

For each processor find the average capacitive loads.

Prescott

> 16

Ivy Bridge

> 14.5

### **Q1.2** Power split

Find the percentage of the total dissipated power comprised by static power. (Give answers out of 100. I.e. 30 is 30%.)

Prescott

> 10

Ivy Bridge

> 43

### **Q1.3** Reducing power

If you wanted to reduce the power for the Ivy Bridge system, which of the following would you try to reduce by 10%?

- [ ] Frequency
- [X] Voltage
- [ ] Static power
- [ ] Dynamic power

## **Q2** Moore's Law

Which of the following is true about Moore's Law?

- [X] Describes an exponential
- [ ] Specifically calls out processor performance
- [X] Only talks about number of transistors per processor
- [ ] Describes the scaling factors for voltage, area, delay, etc. for transistors (devices) as they are scaled.

## **Q3** Technology

Technology is a constant, and thus the best design today will always be the best design.

- [ ] True
- [X] False
