# Quiz 7 Solutions


## **Q1** Executing an instruction
Fill in the blanks below. (Note: Gradescope requires precise answers.) Use the canonical 5 steps to complete an instruction found [here](https://jlpteaching.github.io/ECS154B/materials/processor/single-cycle.html#steps-to-execute-an-instruction-video).

The processor generates control signals for the instruction in

> decode

The processor generates the effective address for load and store instructions in

> execute

The processor may write the instructionâ€™s result to the register file in

> writeback

The instruction is read from memory in

> fetch

Only loads and stores perform a function and other instructions do nothing in

> memory
